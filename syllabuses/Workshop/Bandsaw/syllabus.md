   * Wait for the VFD to start

### Stopping of the machine
 * Both the foot switch and the red button on the bandsaw will cause a VFD stop, and should be used in most situations
 * The E-stop should be pressed in an emergency, this will cut power to the bandsaw
### General
 * Hold workpiece tight, push at a steady rate through the blade.
 * Only work on pieces you can safely hold by yourself. If it's too large, cut it down to a manageable size first. If the workpiece is too small to safely hold, saw it with a hacksaw or use a push stick.
 * Do not push directly towards the blade, either use a push stick or push on the material not towards the blade.
 * Keep work in contact with table or stops. Do not freehand above the surface. Elevated parts will be grabbed by the blade.
 * Do not leave the machine running unattended.
 * Have a wide/stable stance.

### Post Cutting
 * Once you have finished you cut, turn off the bandsaw, log out of the access control, and clean up the table.

## Maintenance
### General
 * If there are any issues, please contact a maintainer listed on the bandsaw wiki page. Example issues: damaged blade, blade out of alignment or terrible noises from moving parts.
