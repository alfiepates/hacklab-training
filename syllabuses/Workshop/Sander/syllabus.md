# Sander

## Safety
### PPE
 * Safety glasses required.
 * Mask/respirator and hearing protection strongly recommended.

### Entanglement risks
 * No loose clothing or cables.
 * Long hair must be tied back.
 * Fingers must be kept at least 10cm away from moving parts.
 * Particular care must be taken around the hole where the belt disappears.

## Startup checks
### Belt/table clear of objects
### Belt aligned correctly
 * Must be centered on the contact wheel (between the brass knobs).

### All adjustments tightened
### No damage to belt/disc
### Machine can manually be spun freely.
 * Belt must stay aligned when spinning the sander manually.

## Usage
### General
 * Hold workpiece tight, but only press it lightly into the abrasive.
 * Only use disc on downward (right-hand) side. Workpiece must be pushed into the table, not upwards and away from it.
 * Keep work in contact with table or stops. Do not freehand above the surface. Elevated parts can grab and pull your fingers towards the abrasive.
 * Do not leave the machine running unattended.
 * Have a wide/stable stance and not lean over the sander.
 * Don't stand in line with the rotation of the sander.
 * Be aware that the workpiece may grab and pull the user in, or be flung away. Use the stops and table to prevent this.

## Maintenance
### General
 * If there are any issues, please contact a maintainer listed on the Sander wiki page. Example issues: frayed/torn/damaged belt or disc, main belt out of alignment or terrible noises from moving parts.
